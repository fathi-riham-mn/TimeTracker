# Time Tracker

A simple time tracking application .
Written in C#/.NET 4 and using the WinForms library,
released publicly as open-source software under the MIT license.


## Features

* Time tracking
* Visual display of currently tracked time
* Set tracking categories (or pick a category that's already in the table)
* Observe immediate totals (statistics for all rows / selection / selected category)
* Delete inconvenient entries
* Open / Save time tracker table files (which use CSV-like format that is easy to process further)
* Generic window manager options (stay on top, show in notification area, ...)
* Language picker (currently available in Czech and English) with Windows' locale autodetection.
* Settings are persisted in local storage


## Usage

1. Star tracking by clicking the ![Start Tracking](/screenshots/btn_start_tracking.png?raw=true) button
2. The two read-only fields now show the time when tracking started and how much time elapsed since then: ![Two fields with absolute time and elapsed time](/screenshots/tracking_info.png?raw=true)
3. Optionally fill in the "category" field: ![A text field with "Awesome Cat" filled in](/screenshots/category_field.png?raw=true)
4. Stop the tracking by clicking the ![Stop Tracking](/screenshots/btn_stop_tracking.png?raw=true) button
5. A new record will appear in the table below: ![Example Time Tracker record](/screenshots/example_record.png?raw=true)

## Installation

You can either grab the [latest release](https://github.com/Amunak/TimeTracker/releases/latest), unpack it and run `timetracker.exe` or compile the software yourself.

### Compiling

Clone this repository, open the solution (`TimeTracker.sln`) in Visual Studio,
pick a configuration (I'd suggest `release` unless you plan to tinker with the code)
and select `Build > Compile Solution`. The built code should appear in the project directory
under `bin/Release`. You'll see `timetracker.exe` here
(along with some generated resource files and default config).
